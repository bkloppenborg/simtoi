# Contributing to SIMTOI

So you are interested in helping us improve SIMTOI? That's awesome! We have
put together some guidelines that should help you get started quickly and
easily. Thank you for stopping by!

## TL; DR

If you need help with SIMTOI, please 
[consult the documentation](https://github.com/bkloppenborg/simtoi/wiki)
first. If your question is not answered there, you may contact either
[Brian Kloppenborg](brian@kloppenborg.net) or [Fabien Baron](fbaron@gsu.edu)
with questions.
If you are [submitting a bug report](#reporting-issues)
please be sure to include as much information as possible so that we may 
replicate and fix the issue.
If you have some code that you want to pull-request, please base your contribution 
against the current development branch and submit your pull request against `develop`. 

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful. Thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports

1. **Use github issue search** - check to see if the issue has already been reported
2. **Check to see if the issue has been fixed** - Attempt to replicae the issue by using
   the latest `develop` branch.
3. **Isolate the problem** - ideally create a reduced test case where the bug happens
4. **Include as much information as possible** - tell us which operating system (vendor
   and version) you are using, what video card you are using, and any other relevant
   information you deem useful to the bug report.

Once you have all of this information, bugs should be reported to the 
[issue tracker](https://github.com/bkloppenborg/simtoi/issues?state=open).

## Feature requests

We are always interested in improving SIMTOI by adding additional functionality,
but before you make a suggestion please:

1. Search for existing 
[enhancements in the issue tracker](https://github.com/bkloppenborg/simtoi/labels/enhancement)
to see if someone else has requested a similar or related feature

2. Remember, it is _up to you_ to make a strong case to convince the project leads
about the merit of the feature. 

## Submitting Pull Requests

Base your changes on `master` but submit your pull-request to `develop`. This
can be changed by clicking the "Edit" button on the pull-request page. The
devel branch is used for integration and testing of changes before merging
into the stable `master` branch.

Please try to rebase your changes on the current master branch before
submitting. This keeps the git history cleaner and easier to understand.

## Documentation

All of our documentation can be found on the 
[SIMTOI wiki](https://github.com/bkloppenborg/simtoi/wiki).
If you would like to write some documentation, please coordinate with either
Brian or Fabien (contact information above). If like to write, but need a little
inspiration, check out our list of items needing documentation on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/bkloppenborg/simtoi/labels/documentation).

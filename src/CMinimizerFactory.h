///
/// This factory is used to register and create instances of minimizers in SIMTOI.
/// As this class is a singleton, the constructor is private. Call the `Instance()`
/// function to get a copy of this object.
///
/// Before any minimizer may be used in SIMTOI, it must be registered with this class.
/// Simply call `Register()` with a unique ID and `CMinimizerPtr` creation function.
/// After the minimizer has been registered it will become available for use in SIMTOI.

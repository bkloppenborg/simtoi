 *  Disk Model A:
 *  This model modifies the edges of the simple CModelDisk to extend radially outward
 *  with an decaying hight that follows a gaussian:
 *
 *  	h(r) = h0 * exp( -(r-r0)^2/(2*h_r^2 )
 *
 *  where h0 is the initial height, r0 is the inner radius of the decaying region and
 *  h_r is a decay factor (akin to scale height)
